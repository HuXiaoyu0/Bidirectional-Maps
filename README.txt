# Bidirectional-Maps
data structure, homework 8
A bidirectional_map is similar to an STL map, in that it stores the association between key and value data. 
Like a map, inserting and erasing an association between a key and a value is completed in O(log n), where n is the number of association pairs in the map. Also, like a map, lookup by key is O(log n), but additionally, with a bidirectional map, lookup by value is also O(log n)!
